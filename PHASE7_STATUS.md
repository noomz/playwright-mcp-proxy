# Phase 7: Restart Recovery - Status Report

## Overview
Enable sessions to survive server restarts by persisting and rehydrating browser state.

---

## ✅ Completed (v0.3.0-dev)

### 1. Design Document (PHASE7_DESIGN.md)
- [x] Comprehensive architecture design
- [x] State capture strategy defined (hybrid approach)
- [x] Rehydration process documented
- [x] Edge cases identified
- [x] Implementation plan (4 sub-phases)

### 2. Database Schema
- [x] Extended sessions table with recovery fields:
  - `current_url`, `cookies`, `local_storage`, `session_storage`
  - `viewport`, `last_snapshot_time`
- [x] Extended state enum:
  - New states: `recoverable`, `stale`, `failed`
  - Existing: `active`, `closed`, `error`
- [x] Created session_snapshots table:
  - Historical snapshots with timestamps
  - Indexed by session_id and time

### 3. Data Models
- [x] SessionSnapshot model created
- [x] Session model extended with recovery fields
- [x] All fields optional (backward compatible)

### 4. Configuration
- [x] session_snapshot_interval: 30s default
- [x] max_session_age: 24h default
- [x] auto_rehydrate: false (manual by default)
- [x] max_session_snapshots: 10 default

## 🚧 In Progress

### Phase 7.1: State Capture Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Schema and models
- [x] Database operations for snapshots
- [x] State extraction from Playwright
- [x] Periodic snapshot mechanism

---

## 📋 Remaining Work

### Phase 7.1 - State Capture ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Capture and persist browser state periodically

Completed:
1. **Database Operations** ✅
   - [x] `save_session_snapshot()` - Save new snapshot
   - [x] `get_latest_session_snapshot()` - Get most recent
   - [x] `get_session_snapshots()` - Get all for session
   - [x] `cleanup_old_snapshots()` - Keep only last N
   - [x] `update_session_state_from_snapshot()` - Update inline fields

2. **State Extraction** ✅
   - [x] Added SessionStateManager class
   - [x] `capture_state()` extracts all browser state
   - [x] `get_current_url()` via browser_evaluate
   - [x] `get_cookies()` via browser_evaluate (document.cookie)
   - [x] `get_local_storage()` via browser_evaluate
   - [x] `get_session_storage()` via browser_evaluate
   - [x] `get_viewport()` via browser_evaluate

3. **Periodic Snapshots** ✅
   - [x] Background task for periodic snapshots
   - [x] Integrated into app lifespan
   - [x] Respects snapshot_interval setting
   - [x] Handles snapshot failures gracefully
   - [x] Cleans up old snapshots automatically

4. **Testing** ✅
   - [x] Test schema migrations (3 tests)
   - [x] Test snapshot CRUD operations
   - [x] Test state extraction accuracy (7 tests)
   - [x] Test periodic snapshot mechanism
   - [x] All 10 tests passing

### Phase 7.2 - Startup Detection
**Goal:** Detect orphaned sessions and mark as recoverable

Tasks:
- [ ] Startup hook in lifespan
- [ ] Detect sessions in 'active' state
- [ ] Check snapshot age
- [ ] Mark as recoverable/stale/closed
- [ ] Add `list_sessions()` tool
- [ ] List sessions by state filter

### Phase 7.3 - Rehydration
**Goal:** Restore browser state from snapshots

Tasks:
- [ ] `rehydrate_session()` function
- [ ] Navigate to saved URL
- [ ] Restore cookies via Playwright
- [ ] Restore localStorage via evaluate
- [ ] Restore sessionStorage via evaluate
- [ ] Set viewport size
- [ ] Add `session_resume(session_id)` tool
- [ ] Handle rehydration failures
- [ ] Update session state after rehydration

### Phase 7.4 - Testing & Polish
**Goal:** Production-ready with full test coverage

Tasks:
- [ ] Integration tests for full flow
- [ ] Test crash/restart scenarios
- [ ] Test edge cases (stale, conflicts)
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Add example scripts
- [ ] Update README
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG
- [ ] Document limitations

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Phase 7 will be complete when:
- [ ] Sessions survive server restart
- [ ] State (URL, cookies, storage) accurately restored
- [ ] Users can list and resume recoverable sessions
- [ ] Graceful handling of rehydration failures
- [ ] Configurable auto-rehydration
- [ ] Performance impact < 5%
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation

---

## 📊 Progress Estimate

**Overall Phase 7:** ~35% complete

- Phase 7.1 (State Capture): ✅ 100% complete
- Phase 7.2 (Detection): 0% complete
- Phase 7.3 (Rehydration): 0% complete (restore_state implemented, needs integration)
- Phase 7.4 (Testing): ~25% complete (unit tests done, integration tests pending)

**Next immediate steps:**
1. Implement startup detection (Phase 7.2)
2. Detect orphaned sessions on startup
3. Mark sessions as recoverable/stale based on age
4. Add list_sessions() tool to MCP client

---

## 🚨 Known Limitations (by design)

These are acceptable limitations documented in PHASE7_DESIGN.md:

1. **Not Real-Time** - Snapshots may be up to snapshot_interval old
2. **No Active State** - Running timers, pending requests lost
3. **Storage Only** - Cannot restore JavaScript heap/closures
4. **Best Effort** - Some sites may break if storage alone is restored
5. **No Dialog State** - Open alerts/confirms lost
6. **Cookie Domains** - Cookies may have domain restrictions

---

## 📝 Notes

- All schema changes are backward compatible
- Existing sessions unaffected
- No breaking changes to API
- Feature can be disabled (auto_rehydrate=false)
- Manual resume always available via session_resume tool
